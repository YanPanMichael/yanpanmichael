  I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, VueJS, NodeJS and GraphQL. In 2022, I was selected to be a senior specialist based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the infrastructure construction which led me to launch several programs, a ecosystem for fetch and some basic tools.
